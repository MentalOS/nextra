NExtra is an open-source library that contains extended functionality
for the .NET Framework. I continously add things from my various .NET
projects, if I find that they are relevant enough.

If I add stuff that I find on blogs or other web resources, I include
links to the original implementation.


Resources
---------

You can find more information about NExtra at the following resources:

	Web site:		http://danielsaidi.github.com/NExtra

Contributions to NExtra are more than welcome. If you build something
that you wish to share, fix a bug, improve a unit test etc. just send
me a pull request requests via GitHub or simply attach your code in a
regular e-mail.


Getting started
---------------

You can grab the source code directly from GitHub or get pre-compiled
binaries from NuGet. If you are new to NExtra, I advice you to grab a
source code bundle, browse through it and pick out the parts you need.


NExtra Projects
---------------

NExtra consists of the following projects:

	NExtra
	NExtra.Web
	NExtra.Mvc
	NExtra.Wpf
	NExtra.WebForms
	NExtra.WinForms
	
The NExtra namespace extends System, and can be used in most projects.
The other projects depend on the corresponding System libraries. This
means that NExtra.Web requires System.Web etc.


Documentation
-------------

From version 3.0, I have decided to not extract any documentation for
NExtra. I believe that it is easier to grab the source code and check
it out, or even browse through the code on GitHub, than it is to plow
through page after page within a generated HTML structure.
