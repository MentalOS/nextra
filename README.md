NExtra is an open-source library that contains extended functionality
for the .NET Framework. I continously add things from my various .NET
projects, if I find that they are relevant enough.

If I add stuff that I find on blogs or other web resources, I include
links to the original implementation.


Getting started
---------------

You can grab the source code directly from GitHub or get pre-compiled
binaries from NuGet. If you are new to NExtra, I advice you to grab a
source code bundle, browse through it and pick out the parts you need.


NExtra Projects
---------------

NExtra consists of the following projects:

	NExtra
	NExtra.Web
	NExtra.Mvc
	NExtra.WebForms
	NExtra.WinForms
	
The NExtra namespace extends System, and can be used in most projects.
The other projects depend on the corresponding System libraries. This
means that NExtra.Web requires System.Web etc.
