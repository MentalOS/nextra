NExtra is a library with extended functionality for the .NET
Framework. It contains tools, extension methods, interfaces,
utilities, UI components this, that etc. etc. Hopefully, it
is well structured and intuitive.

I continously add new functionality that I create, no matter
which part of the .NET Framework it regards. Implementations
that I find in blog post or such will contain links to their
original implementations.

Contributions to the library are more than welcome. Just let
me know if you want to help out in any way.


License
=======

NExtra is released under the MIT License, which you can read
more about here:

It basically means that you can do whatever you want with it,
but that you are more than welcome spread the word.


Documentation
=============

The solution is fully documented and uses Doxygen to extract
a HTML documentation for each new release. The documentation
can be found at my personal web site:

If I haven't updated the documentation for a certain release,
send me an e-mail and I'll do it asap.
