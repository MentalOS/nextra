NExtra is an open-source library with functionality for .NET.

I continously add new things that I create in my other hobby
projects, if they are general enough and may help others out.

Stuff that I find in blog post or such will contain links to
the original implementation and author. 

Contributions to the library are more than welcome. Just let
me know if you want to help out in any way.
